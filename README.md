# Ridiculous Generation Simulation

Once upon a time, there was a bored CS student. He wanted to know if a
population could be stable. He decided to fiddle with the lovely Ruby language,
objects and contracts.

**Disclaimer:** I'm not a biologist, mathematician or any kind of reproduction
expert, just a bored student :)

## Usage

Exemple for a study on 10 generations with a starting population of 50
indivdiduals in which each couple can have a maximum of 4 offsprings:

```
$ ruby rgs.rb 10 50 4
Population at gen 1: 50
Population at gen 2: 51
Population at gen 3: 33
Population at gen 4: 26
Population at gen 5: 17
Population at gen 6: 16
Population at gen 7: 17
Population at gen 8: 14
Population at gen 9: 14
Population at gen 10: 7
```
